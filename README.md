# Integrations challenge

Medcloud's challenge for the general integrations internship vacancy.

## Problem

We need a system with a local CRUD and database to manage a collection of patients, and in real-time, replicate the inserts/edits/deletes on a remote database.

## Spec

Fell free to develop the CRUD on any language and framework.
In the cloud, you MUST use the AWS Free Tier for your database (PostgreSQL) and SOAP API that you will use to interact with your local database.
Locally, you MUST use Docker to host your database (MySQL) and CRUD.

## References

You can use a EC2 instance to host your SOAP API. https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/.

## Delivery

You MUST fork this repository to your own account and push you code to it. When you finish it, you must send a email to cv@medcloud.com.br with your curriculum, fork, DockerHub image and how many time you managed to complete the challenge.

Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send a email to cv@medcloud.com.br.
